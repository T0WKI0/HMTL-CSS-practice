        <h1>World’s Largest Wildlife Crossing is Going Up So Animals Can Walk Safely Over 8 Lanes of L.A. Traffic</h1>
        <p>Construction of the “largest wildlife crossing in the world” passed a significant milestone in April placing the first girders over an 8-lane freeway near Los Angeles to preserve the local mountain lion population.</p>
        <p>After years of tireless work, erecting the first horizontal section of the 210-foot-long crossing was an historic moment for the National Wildlife Federation, the Caltrans highway department, and many private and public partners.</p>
        <p id="quote">“We all cheered when the crane lowered the first concrete beam across the freeway, as we truly saw the bridge starting to take shape,” said an excited Beth Pratt, the California Executive Director of National Wildlife Federation.</p>
        <p>“This structure is a testament to us all wanting a future for wildlife and mountain lions in the Santa Monica Mountains.”</p>
        <p>Moving forward, up to 82 additional concrete girders will be placed, with each beam weighing between 126 and 140 tons. As these critical horizontal supports are placed, the structure will ultimately reconnect two long fractured global biodiversity hotspots in the Southern California region—providing safe passage for not only the cougars, but bobcats, deer, lizards, and coyotes, as they move between the Santa Monica Mountains and the Simi Hills of the Santa Susana mountain range.</p>
        <p>The bridge will not only keep animals safe, it will reduce human-wildlife traffic accidents—as every year in the U.S. more than a million wildlife-vehicle collisions result in 200 deaths and 26,000 injuries to drivers and passengers.</p>
